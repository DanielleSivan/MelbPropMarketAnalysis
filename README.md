Melbourne Property Market Analysis 2018-2020

I analysed data about Melbourne's property market. The data includes more than 98K rows of transactions that occurred from 2018 to 2020. I built a few dashboards using DAX and slicers that helps users to extract the specific information they are looking for. For example, the user can type the name of a suburb and a property type and see all the related data. In addition, you can see the price trends (average and median) for every suburb, property type (house, townhouse, unit), and number of bedrooms.

Top 15 selling suburbs dashboard - the colors in the map visualise the change in the price of a 3 bedroom house (the most popular property). Furthermore, the user can drill down by click on the suburb’s name and the property type to see the distribution of sales by property type and number of bedrooms. Once again, the user can see a chart about the average / median price for a 3 bedroom house for that suburb.

The insight dashboard describes insights for the top 15 selling suburbs dashboard. By using bookmarks, the user can click on the info buttons + ctrl, which leads him to the specific dashboard with the relevant information as described in the insights.

Top 25 selling suburbs for 3 bedroom houses dashboard – the colors in the map visualise the change in the price for a 3 bedroom house in the top 25 selling suburbs for 3 bedroom houses (red = price decreased, green = price increased, blue = increased strongly). The bar chart illustrate the price for a 3 bedroom house by suburb in descending order. The colors in the bar chart emphasise the change in the price between YTD 2020 to YTD 2019. In addition, the user can click on a specific suburb (or select a suburb from the slicer) and all the cards and information will be updated to that specific suburb.
